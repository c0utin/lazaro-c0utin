# Lazaro

**Lazaro** is a CLI training app inspired by Boostcamp that lets you manage your workouts with ease. With Lazaro, you can create and manage training sessions, exercises, and training programsâ€”all from the command line. The goal is to keep things as simple as possible: just run `lazaro init` to create a local `lazaro.db` file in the current directory, and then use the available commands to manage your workouts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16 or higher

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/misterclayt0n/lazaro
cd lazaro
```

## Usage

Lazaro is designed to be simple and straightforward. Below is an overview of the available commands.

### Database Initialization

Initialize the database in the current directory by running:

```bash
./lazaro init
```

This command creates a `lazaro.db` file and sets up the database schema.

### Training Sessions

- **Start a session:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro start-session --program "MyProgram" --block "Workout A" [--week 1]
  ```

  Starts a new training session for the specified program and block (and week, if applicable).

- **End the current session:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro end-session
  ```

- **Cancel the current session:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro cancel-session
  ```

- **View current session details:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro show-session
  ```

- **Look up a session by its ID or date:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro look-session [session-id]
  ./lazaro look-session --date 07/02/25
  ```

### Exercises

- **Add a new exercise:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro add-exercise --name "Bench Press" --muscle "Chest" --description "Flat bench press with barbell"
  ```

- **Import exercises from a TOML file:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro import-exercises exercises.toml
  ```

- **View exercise details and history:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro show-ex "Bench Press"
  ```

### Training Programs

- **Create a new training program from a TOML file:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro create-program program.toml
  ```

- **List all programs:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro list-programs
  ```

- **Update an existing program without losing session data:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro update-program program.toml
  ```

- **Delete a program:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro delete-program program.toml
  ```

- **Display a complete program (optionally filtering by day):**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro show-program "MyProgram" --day "Workout A"
  ```

### Exporting and Importing Data

- **Export the database to a TOML file:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro export mydump.toml
  ```

  If no file name is provided, a default file (e.g., `db_dump.toml`) is used in the default directory.

- **Rebuild the database from a TOML dump:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro build-db mydump.toml
  ```

### Other Commands

- **View the training calendar:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro calendar [month] [year]
  ```

- **Display overall statistics (total weight lifted, sessions, gym hours, etc.):**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro status
  ```

- **Swap an exercise variation during a session:**

  ```bash
  ./lazaro swap-ex 2 "VariationX"
  ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Starting a Session

```bash
./lazaro start-session --program "Hypertrophy2025" --block "Day A" --week 1
```

Starts a session for the program "Hypertrophy2025" on "Day A" for week 1.

### Example 2: Exporting the Database

```bash
./lazaro export workout_dump.toml
```

Exports the current database to `workout_dump.toml`.

### Example 3: Displaying the Calendar

```bash
./lazaro calendar 2 2025
```

Displays the calendar for February 2025, marking the days with training sessions.
